Public view of the computer-graphics repo: My implementation of projects done as part of CS 373 Computer Graphics at UMass

### **If you would like to see the code implementation, please get in touch with me with the methods outlined on my resume, or use the provided links on my resume. I cannot distribute this code publicly due to academic honesty guidelines**

The private repo contains code for my implementation of 6 JavaScript computer graphics projects done as part of CS 373 Computer Graphics during the Spring of 2024 @ UMass. 

**Project 1 Scene Creation**:
Showcases a basic object scene in which a model is loaded into the scene, and can be cycled through a list of models. Raycasting is used to add support for rotating the camera in 3D space to inspect different angles of the object.

**Project 2 Image Processing**:
Showcases an implementation of many common image processing operations like brightness, saturation, contrast, sharpening, blur, dither, edge detection, and even tile mosaic. Achieved mainly through using convolution kernels, and interpolation.

**Project 3 Smooth Curves & Surfaces**:
Showcase of various smooth curve algorithms including Bezier, Cubic B-Spline, and a Cubic Hermite Curve, each with their unique pros and cons. The right side of each image showcases the 3D surface achieved by rotating each curve around a vertical axis.

**Project 4 Subdivision**:
Showcases an implementation of Loop's Subdivision algorithm that takes in a 3D mesh, and subdivides each face into 4 new faces at each step of iteration in order to achieve a more "natural/smooth" looking object. Includes support for wireframe and flat/smooth rendering.

**Project 5 Scene Modeling**:
Showcases the use of groups to create a hierarchical model of a scene, allowing for 3D transformations at different "levels" of sets of objects

**Project 6 Raytracing**:
Showcases a basic implementation of a recursive raytracing algorithm with support for ambient lighting, point lights, spot lights, area lights, diffusion, specular shading, refraction, reflection, and mirror surfaces
